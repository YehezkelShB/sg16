# SG16 Operating Procedures

This document details the operating procedures that govern collaboration in SG16.  Specifically, it details
the processes used by SG16 to abide by
[SD-4: WG21 Practices and Procedures](https://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-4-wg21-practices-and-procedures).
These procedures are also intended to align with those described in
[P2145: Evolving C++ Remotely](https://wg21.link/p2145).

# Contact

For any questions or concerns regarding these procedures, please contact the SG16 chair at tom@honermann.net.

# Code of conduct

SG16 follows the WG21 code of conduct described in
[SD-4: WG21 Practices and Procedures](https://isocpp.org/std/standing-documents/sd-4-wg21-practices-and-procedures#code-of-conduct).

# Collaboration

SG16 welcomes participation from anyone with applicable C++, Unicode, and/or text processing expertise
from around the globe.  The following resources are available to accommodate such participation.

## Mailing list

The SG16 mailing list is open to the public.  Subscription information and archives are available at
https://lists.isocpp.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/sg16.  The mailing list is intended for general
organizational use, technical discussion, and dissemination of other relevant information.

## Slack

Most informal discussion occurs on Slack in the
[sg16_unicode channel within the Cpplang workspace](https://cpplang.slack.com/messages/sg16_unicode).
Participants will require an invitation to the Cpplang workspace to join the channel.  An invitation
can be requested by contacting the SG16 chair via the contact information listed above.

## Meetings

Two forms of meetings take place:
- **Telecons** are held approximately twice a month.  These are public meetings and summaries of them are
  made publicly available at https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings and in WG21 papers such as
  [P1666](https://wg21.link/p1666).  Meeting times and draft agendas are posted to the SG16 Slack channel
  and at https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings.  Invitations are sent to the mailing list and to
  prior attendees.  An invitation can be requested by contacting the SG16 chair via the contact information
  listed above.
- **Face to face** meetings are held at WG21 meetings.  Attendees must follow the normal WG21 procedures
  to attend.  Remote access may be made available for recognized experts at the SG16 chair's discretion
  pending available technical equipment.  Summaries of these meetings are **not** made public in accordance
  with WG21 procedures, but anonymized poll questions and results may be quoted in public facing documents.

# Polling and Decision Making

Consensus requires a quorum of regular attendees and acknowledged experts.  Both quorum and consensus are
determined by the chair.  The chair conducts polls.  Polls may be conducted at both telecons and face to
face meetings.

For various reasons, including but not limited to travel and timezone challenges, some expert participants
will be unable to attend either telecons or face to face meetings.  SG16 has a responsibility to ensure
that the perspectives and expertise of such experts is included in decsion making.

# Revisiting Prior Decisions

Prior SG16 decisions may be revisited, at the chair's discretion, if new information on a topic becomes
available.  However, the process of revisiting a prior decision differs depending on the actions that have
followed that decision.
- If SG16 has communicated a decision to an upstream subgroup, but that subgroup has not yet taken further
  action on that decision, then the prior decision can be revisited within SG16 via an appeal to the chair
  and presentation of new information.  The chair will then notify the upstream subgroup that the decision
  is being reconsidered.
- If SG16 has communicated a decision to an upstream subgroup, and that subgroup has taken further action on
  that decision, then revisiting the decision will require one of two approaches:
  - An appeal to the upstream subgroup chair to revisit the decision in the upstream subgroup.  The upstream
    subgroup chair will then decide to revisit the matter either in the upstream subgroup or will send the
    matter back to SG16 to return with a recommendation.
  - A new paper arguing for a new position.  Such a paper can be targeted to either SG16, the upstream
    subgroup, or both.  The respective chairs will then schedule the paper for further discussion.
