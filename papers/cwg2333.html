<h1>Core Issue 2333: Escape sequences in UTF-8 character literals</h1>

<p>
The notes for <a href="http://wg21.link/cwg2333">CWG 2333</a> in the current
active issues list (revision 100) state that discussion at the
<a href="http://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21albuquerque/IssuesTeleconference2017-08-14">
August, 2017 CWG teleconference</a> resulted in a determination that numeric
escape sequences in UTF-8 character literals should be ill-formed.  The issue
has remained in drafting status since then.
</p>

<p>
SG16 discussed this issue during its October 17th, 2018 teleconference.  Notes
for this meeting are available at
<a href="https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings#october-17th-2018">
https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings#october-17th-2018</a>.  SG16
consensus was for a different resolution than is currently described in the
active issues list.  The SG16 consensus was based on the following observations:
<ul>
  <li>The current resolution in the active issues list contradicts existing
      practice.  gcc, Clang, and MSVC all allow octal and hexadecimal escape
      sequences in UTF-8 literals.</li>
  <li>Octal and hexadecimal escape sequences in UTF-8 literals are useful for
      a number of purposes:
    <ul>
      <li>Embedding null characters: <tt>u8"\0"</tt></li>
      <li>Creating ill-formed code unit sequences for testing purposes.</li>
      <li>Creating Modified UTF-8, CESU-8, and WTF-8 string literals.  This
          entails two abilities:
        <ul>
          <li>Embedding <tt>U+0000</tt> as an overlong UTF-8 sequence:
              <tt>u8"\xC0\x80"</tt></li>
          <li>Embedding lone surrogate code points as individual UTF-8 code
              unit sequences.  For example, encoding <tt>U+D800</tt> as
              <tt>u8"\xED\xA0\x80"</tt>.  (Note that use of <tt>\u</tt> escapes
              specifying surrogate code points is ill-formed).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Compatibility with existing log/debug systems that output literals
          with non-printable characters represented with escapes so as to
          facilitate copy/paste of such output into code.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
SG16 conducted the following poll:
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
Continue to allow hex and octal escapes that indicate code unit values,
requiring only that they fit into the range of the code unit type?
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>SF</th>
    <th>F</th>
    <th>N</th>
    <th>A</th>
    <th>SA</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
</table>
In the polled question, "Continue" refers to existing implementation behavior;
to maintain the current implementation status quo exhibited by gcc, Clang and
MSVC.
</div>
</p>

<p>
The proposed resolution below reflects the SG16 consensus.
</p>


<h1>Proposed resolution</h1>

<p>
Clarify that hexadecimal and octal escape sequences in <tt>u8</tt>, <tt>u</tt>,
and <tt>U</tt> character literals may specify values that need not correspond
to code point values that are representable in the applicable encoding with a
single code unit.
